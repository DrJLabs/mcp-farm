# QA Review: Story 2.1 — Repo-Level Ruff & Prettier Baseline

Date: 2025-09-16
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Scope aligns with Epic 2 Seed S1. Implementation introduces shared Ruff config, repo-level pre-commit hooks, and contributor documentation.
- Validation commands executed on feature branch: `uvx ruff check .`, `uvx ruff format --check .`, `npx prettier --check '**/*.{md,mdx,json,yaml,yml}'`.
- Issue #5 comment (2025-09-16) logs successful runs and new file locations.

## Findings
- ✅ Root `pyproject.toml` enumerates intended directories and sets `target-version = "py311"` (matches project baseline).
- ✅ `.pre-commit-config.yaml` pins Ruff v0.5.7 and Prettier v3.3.2 with explicit `types_or` coverage.
- ✅ `.prettierignore` excludes large template directories, keeping hook focused on repo-owned docs.
- ✅ Docs/testing quickstart provides step-by-step commands and troubleshooting hints.
- ⚠️ Follow-up: consolidate `tool.ruff` settings under `fastmcp/pyproject.toml` (Story 2.2) to avoid divergence — tracked separately.

## Decision
- QA Review Result: PASS — ready to advance to QA Gate once trace/NFR recorded.
- Evidence archived under docs/qa/assessments and Issue #5 comment.
