Date: 2025-09-17
Story: docs/stories/2.2.harmonize-config-and-type-checks.md

## Checklist Summary
- Clarity: Scope and objective clearly state consolidation of Ruff/Ty configs tied to Issue #5. PASS.
- Acceptance Criteria: Six measurable outcomes with explicit evidence locations (commands, issue comment, trace table). PASS.
- Tasks: Subtasks map to config updates, validation commands, and communication deliverables. PASS.
- Dependencies: Only Story 2.1 prerequisite remains satisfied; no additional blockers. PASS.
- References: Links to seed epic, tooling plan, and Issue #5 maintained. PASS.
- Evidence: QA deliverables (risk, test design, trace, NFR) now recorded; validation commands executed via `uv run`. PASS.

## Decision
Validation Result: PASS (Implementation)

Notes:
- Keep Issue #5 as the aggregation point for reducing Ty ignore counts.
- When CI story lands, ensure `uv run ty check` is wired into pipeline to preserve parity noted here.

Final Decision: **READY FOR MERGE** — Story 2.2 meets acceptance criteria with supporting evidence captured.
