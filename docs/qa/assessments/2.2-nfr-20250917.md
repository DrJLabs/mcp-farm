# QA NFR Assessment â€” Story 2.2: Harmonize Package Configs & Type Checks

Date: 2025-09-17
Story: docs/stories/2.2.harmonize-config-and-type-checks.md
Scope: Config parity across repo root and fastmcp package for linting and type analysis

## Evaluated NFRs

| NFR | Status | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | ------ | ---------------- |
| Security | PASS | Consolidated Ruff configuration eliminates drift that previously left UP017/UP035 findings unresolved; clean `uvx ruff check` run demonstrates the shared policy is enforced across sample and package code. |
| Performance | PASS | Tooling upgrades rely on CLI utilities only; no runtime code paths affected. Latest Ruff release (0.13.0) runs locally via `uvx` without added latency to CI. |
| Reliability | PASS | Ty configuration now centralised in root `pyproject.toml`, ensuring repeated `uv run ty check` executions produce deterministic results; Issue #5 documents fallback to Ruff-only/mypy if Ty regresses. |
| Maintainability | PASS | All suppressions documented with inline comments and Issue #5 references; QA trace matrix captured for ongoing audits. Shared configs reduce duplication across repos. |

Quality Score: 100

## Gate YAML Snippet
```yaml
nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Shared Ruff baseline removes stale ignores; lint pass recorded in Issue #5.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Tooling upgrades limited to CLI usage; no runtime regressions detected.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Ty runs consistently from root and package contexts; fallback documented.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Suppressions documented; QA trace ensures future audits can verify scope parity.'
```

## Observations & Follow-ups
- Continue tracking Ty ignore reductions in Issue #5 to maintain downward trend.
- Consider scripting `ruff settings` parity once upstream command lands to automate AC4 evidence collection.
