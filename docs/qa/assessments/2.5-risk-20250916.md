# Risk Profile: Story 2.5 — Developer Experience Documentation

Date: 2025-09-16
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary
- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 70/100 (calculated)

Risks are primarily operational and business-oriented—if documentation is incomplete or inaccurate, developers regress into ad hoc tooling usage. Ensuring accuracy and version alignment is key.

## Risk Distribution
- Security: 0
- Performance: 0
- Data: 0
- Business: 2 (0 critical)
- Operational: 3 (1 high)

## Detailed Risk Register

### OPS-501: Documentation drifts from actual commands (High)
- Probability: Medium (2)
- Impact: High (3)
- Score: 6 (High)
- Description: Docs may list outdated commands or omit prerequisites (Node 18, uv install).
- Mitigation: Validate commands manually; cross-check with README quickstart.
- Testing Focus: Copy/paste commands during review.

### OPS-502: Onboarding checklist not updated
- Probability: Medium (2)
- Impact: Medium (2)
- Score: 4 (Medium)
- Description: New contributors miss steps.
- Mitigation: Add acceptance criterion requiring checklist update.

### BUS-501: Issue #5 not updated with doc links
- Probability: Medium (2)
- Impact: Medium (2)
- Score: 4 (Medium)
- Description: Stakeholders unaware of documentation changes.
- Mitigation: Ensure confirmation comment.

### OPS-503: Prettier/Node prerequisites unclear
- Probability: Medium (2)
- Impact: Low (1)
- Score: 2 (Low)
- Mitigation: Document Node version requirement and `corepack enable`.

### BUS-502: Documentation lacks troubleshooting guidance
- Probability: Medium (2)
- Impact: Low (1)
- Score: 2 (Low)
- Mitigation: Include failure recovery tips (clear cache, reinstall hooks).

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy
- Priority 1: Manual validation of commands in docs/validation.md and README quickstart.
- Priority 2: Review onboarding checklist diff to ensure steps included.
- Priority 3: Confirm Issue #5 comment references doc updates.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria
- Must Fix Before Merge: OPS-501.
- Can Defer With Ticket: OPS-503, BUS-502 (if time constrained but tracked).

## Monitoring Requirements (post-merge optional)
- Reevaluate documentation after first sprint of usage; collect developer feedback.
