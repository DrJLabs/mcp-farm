# QA Review — Story 1.2: Traefik Routing + TLS Labels

Date: 2025-09-15
Story: docs/stories/1.2.traefik-routing-and-tls-labels.md

## Summary
- Readiness for Gate: CONDITIONAL — pending runtime HTTPS health evidence.
- Overall Quality: Strong; story aligns with PRD FR5 and architecture; tasks actionable.

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story draft: docs/stories/1.2.traefik-routing-and-tls-labels.md (Status: InProgress)
- Trace: docs/qa/assessments/1.2-trace-20250915.md
- Risk Profile: docs/qa/assessments/1.2-risk-profile-20250915.md
- NFR Assessment: docs/qa/assessments/1.2-nfr-20250915.md
- Test Design: docs/qa/assessments/1.2-test-design-20250915.md
- Compose and app files present in repo.

## Findings
- ACs are testable; evidence path defined.
- Routing and TLS labels present; optional KC shim correctly deferred (S6 scope).
- No static Traefik files detected.
- Remaining gap: runtime evidence curl via Traefik.

## Recommendation
- Proceed to implementation validation steps to collect evidence, then update story checkboxes and mark Ready for Review.

## Gate Suggestion
- Decision: CONCERNS — Missing evidence. Flip to PASS once evidence is attached (see gate file).
