# Story Draft Checklist — Story 1.2 (Traefik Routing + TLS Labels)

Date: 2025-09-15
Story: docs/stories/1.2.traefik-routing-and-tls-labels.md

## Quick Summary
- Story readiness: READY
- Clarity score: 9/10
- Major gaps: None blocking (RFC 8414 shim intentionally deferred to S6)

## Validation Results
| Category                             | Status | Notes |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ----- |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS   | Role–action–benefit clear; dependency on 1.1 noted; epic linkage implicit via S2 scope. |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS   | Key artifacts (compose, Traefik labels, envs) named; concrete label examples provided. |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS   | Specific shards cited (Traefik reference, PRD ingress, Validation). |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS   | Core info included; external refs augment but are not required to understand tasks. |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PASS   | HTTPS health curl specified with expected output and evidence capture. |

## Specific Issues & Recommendations
- None blocking. Keep RFC 8414 shim out of scope for S2 to prevent scope creep; ensure label snippets match the chosen Traefik version when implementing.

## Developer Perspective
- Implementable as written without extra documents. No open questions beyond environment specifics (hostnames/certs) which are covered by the reference.
