- Acceptance Criteria: Objective, measurable commands (Ruff, Prettier, documentation) map to success metrics. PASS.
- Tasks: Subtasks cover configuration, automation, command validation, and documentation updates with clear owners. PASS.

- Add pointer in acceptance evidence to CI lint job once story is implemented to aid SM/QA traceability.
