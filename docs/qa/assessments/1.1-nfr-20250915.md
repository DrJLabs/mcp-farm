# NFR Assessment: Story 1.1 — Bootstrap Env and Healthcheck

Date: 2025-09-15
Story: docs/stories/1.1.bootstrap-env-and-healthcheck.md

## Summary
Scope limited to baseline env template and unauthenticated health endpoint.

## Assessment
- Performance: Health route is constant-time JSON; negligible CPU/latency. PASS.
- Reliability: Endpoint simple; verified manual smoke works across restarts. PASS.
- Security: Health is unauthenticated by design and returns no sensitive data. Ensure no stack traces or version leaks. PASS with note.
- Observability: Suitable for readiness checks; logs via uvicorn. Consider structured logging in later stories. PASS.
- Operability: Defaults (`BIND_HOST`, `BIND_PORT`) documented; container vs local behavior clarified. PASS.
- Compatibility: Works without Traefik; later stories will verify behind proxy. PASS.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Misconfigured binds (127.0.0.1 vs 0.0.0.0) in containers → Documented and defaulted to 0.0.0.0 in template.
- Accidental sensitive exposure via health → Response is fixed minimal JSON; keep as-is.

## Decision
NFR Gate: PASS for Story 1.1.
