# QA NFR Assessment — Story 1.2: Traefik Routing + TLS Labels

Date: 2025-09-15
Story: docs/stories/1.2.traefik-routing-and-tls-labels.md

## Evaluated NFRs (scope-limited to S2)

| NFR | Description | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | ----------- | ------ | -------------- |
| NFR1 | Linux + Docker; label/env-driven | PASS | `compose.yaml` defines Traefik + MCP; no external config files. |
| NFR2 | OAuth 2.1 + PKCE | N/A (S2) | Covered in S4+. Not in scope for S2. |
| NFR3 | No realm structural changes | N/A (S2) | Keycloak present only as optional; no realm edits in S2. |
| NFR4 | Secrets not committed; logs redact tokens | PARTIAL | No secrets in repo; token redaction applies later when auth is added. Re-verify in S4. |
| NFR5 | Traefik-only routing; label blocks | PASS | Routing via labels; optional discovery shim labels staged; still label-only. |
| NFR6 | Bootstrap new OAuth-enabled MCP ≤30 min | PARTIAL | S2 contributes by enabling TLS routing; full measurement after S7. |

## Risks & Mitigations
- ACME/TLS issuance may fail on local; use self-signed or mkcert; accept `curl -k` for dev evidence.
- Ensure `/etc/hosts` entries for local testing; real DNS in shared environments.

## Decision
- NFR posture acceptable for S2 to proceed. Reassess NFR2/4/6 at S4–S7 milestones.
