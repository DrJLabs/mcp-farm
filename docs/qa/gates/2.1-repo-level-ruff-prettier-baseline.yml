story: "2.1 â€” Repo-Level Ruff & Prettier Baseline"
id: "2.1"
slug: "repo-level-ruff-prettier-baseline"
date: "2025-09-16"
epic: 2
decision: PASS
rationale: |
  Root lint/format configuration now lives at repo level, hooks cover all Python and
  documentation assets, and contributor guidance reflects the workflow. Commands were
  executed to prove a clean baseline.
conditions_to_pass:
  - "Root pyproject.toml defines Ruff src targets (fastmcp/src, tests, sample MCP, scripts)"
  - "Repo .pre-commit-config.yaml installs Ruff lint/format and Prettier >=3.3"
  - "uvx ruff check . and uvx ruff format --check . succeed on clean tree"
  - "npx prettier --check '**/*.{md,mdx,json,yaml,yml}' reports zero changes"
  - "Documentation (docs/testing.md) updated and linked in Issue #5"
