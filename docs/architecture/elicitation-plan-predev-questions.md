# Elicitation Plan (Pre‑Dev Questions)
- Identity & OAuth:
  - KC realm URL and client config? Token TTL, clock skew, and refresh policy?
  - Required scopes (if any) for tools; are fine‑grained scopes needed?
  - Audience policy: single `MCP_SERVER_URL` or dual (`MCP_ALT_AUDIENCE`) for compatibility?
- Networking & TLS:
  - Final hostnames and certificates; staging vs prod endpoints? HSTS desired?
  - Any corporate proxy or split‑DNS constraints?
- Transport & Performance:
  - Minimum streaming cadence and max payload per chunk? Client idle timeout?
  - Concurrency expectations (simultaneous chats) and CPU/RAM budget per container?
- Logs & Observability:
  - Retention days; log redaction requirements beyond Authorization header?
  - Centralized logging target (e.g., Loki/ELK) and required fields?
- Operations & SLOs:
  - Target uptime (MVP) and maintenance windows? Restart policy?
  - Backup/restore needs (config only vs data later)?
- Compliance & Security:
  - Any audit requirements (who accessed what, when)? Time source policy (NTP)?
  - Threats of concern (DoS, token replay, trace leakage) and acceptance posture?
