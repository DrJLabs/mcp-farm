# Checklist Results Report
 - PM Checklist: Comprehensive mode run on 2025-09-15

Summary
- Problem Definition & Context: PASS (minor clarifications suggested)
- MVP Scope Definition: PASS (explicit out-of-scope recommended)
- UX Requirements: WAIVED (backend service; no end-user UI)
- Functional Requirements: PASS (testable FRs, dependencies, gates)
- Non-Functional Requirements: PASS with notes (security solid; perf/reliability minimal for MVP)

Details
- 1.1 Problem Statement: PASS — Goal and audience (single maintainer) clear; add a one-line explicit problem statement for clarity.
- 1.2 Goals & Success Metrics: PASS — “MVP done in ChatGPT” and “≤30 min bootstrap” measurable; consider adding a target date/baseline.
- 1.3 Research & Insights: WAIVED — internal tool for solo maintainer; no market research required.
- 2.1 Core Functionality: PASS — FR/NFR and stories map to goal; acceptance gates defined.
- 2.2 Scope Boundaries: CONCERN — Add explicit Out-of-Scope list (e.g., multi-tenant UI, non-Keycloak IdPs, non‑Traefik ingress).
- 2.3 MVP Validation: PASS — PRM/AS/401 checks + Streamable‑HTTP acceptance signal and ChatGPT onboarding.
- 3.x UX: WAIVED — no product UI; retain section as N/A.
- 4.1–4.3 Functional Quality: PASS — FRs are specific and MCP‑spec aligned; stories sequenced; add per‑story ACs if needed later.
- 5.1 Performance: TODO — note acceptable streaming latency/timeouts (e.g., initial headers <2s; keep‑alive configured).
- 5.2 Security & Compliance: PASS — OAuth 2.1 + PKCE, JWKS, header‑only bearer, log redaction.
- 5.3 Reliability & Resilience: TODO — document minimal expectations (e.g., restart policy, health endpoint routed via Traefik).
- 5.4 Technical Constraints: PASS — FastMCP, Keycloak, Traefik, Docker captured.

Action Items
- A1: Add Out-of-Scope list under Release Strategy or a new section. [Owner: PM]
- A2: Add one‑line explicit problem statement at top of Background. [Owner: PM]
- A3: Record minimal perf/reliability notes (timeouts, healthcheck, restart). [Owner: PM]
