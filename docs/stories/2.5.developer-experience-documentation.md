# Story 2.5: Developer Experience Documentation

Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** product owner onboarding new contributors,
**I want** up-to-date documentation describing the lint, format, type check, and test workflow,
**so that** developers can self-serve the baseline commands and avoid CI surprises.

Dependencies: Stories 2.1–2.4 (tooling implemented and CI in place).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `docs/validation.md` (or new `docs/testing.md`) includes sections covering Ruff (lint + format), Prettier, ty, and pytest commands with step-by-step instructions.
2. README.md contains a quickstart snippet (<10 lines) summarizing the primary commands (`uvx ruff format`, `uvx ruff check`, `uv run ty check`, `uv run pytest --cov`).
3. Documentation references GitHub issue #5 and links to workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for deeper context.
4. Onboarding checklist (if present in `onboarding-chatgpt.md` or similar) is updated to include running pre-commit hooks and the full validation suite.
5. Docs reviewed by QA or PM; a confirmation comment is added to Issue #5 with links to updated sections.

Evidence: Link to diff or published docs demonstrating updates; screenshot optional for onboarding doc.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update validation/testing docs
  - [ ] Add or revise section covering command usage, expected outputs, and failure recovery tips.
  - [ ] Include note on installing pre-commit hooks (`uvx pre-commit install`).
- [ ] README quickstart
  - [ ] Insert quickstart snippet; ensure `toc` unaffected.
- [ ] Onboarding checklist update
  - [ ] Modify `docs/onboarding-chatgpt.md` (or relevant doc) to include new tooling steps.
- [ ] Cross-linking
  - [ ] Add references to Issue #5 and `docs/issues/testing-tooling-baseline.md` if relocated.
- [ ] Stakeholder review
  - [ ] Request QA/PM sign-off and post confirmation comment in Issue #5.

## Dev Notes

- Keep command blocks short; prefer fenced code blocks with explanatory bullet list.
- Include troubleshooting tips (e.g., clearing `~/.cache/uv` if sync fails).
- Mention Node version requirement for Prettier (≥18) to mitigate OPS-205 risk.
